    <paragraph id="2.6.1" type="TITLE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Introduction</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.1.1" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to express the possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are principally related to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on-board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on-board equipment respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.1.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to the required performance. 
Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.1.3" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is used for operation on non-equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines, which are in commissioning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.2" type="TITLE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Definitions</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.2.1" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment always co-operates with the ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.2.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">All transitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.2.3" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK" >ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:
- ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line without ERTMS/ETCS or national system or with the ERTMS/ETCS systems in
commissioning)
- ERTMS/ETCS Level STM (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with a national system to which it interfaces by use of an STM)
- ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally Euroloop or Radio infill)
- ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside
- ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train integrity supervision based on information received from the train)</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.2.4" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for example to run trains without train integrity device in level 2 and in parallel trains equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel operation
of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.2.5" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK" >Levels 1, 2 and 3 are downwards compatible. This means that:
• a level 3 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0, level 1 and level 2
• a level 2 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0 and level 1
• a level 1 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0 
</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="2.6.3.1.1" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or national systems or on lines which are in commissioning, e.g. where trackside
ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure may exist but has to be ignored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.3.1.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">In Level 0 line side optical signals or other means of signalling external to ERTMS/ETCS are used to give movement authorities to the driver.</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="2.6.3.1.4" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.3.1.5" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Level 0 uses no track-train transmission except Eurobalises to announce/command level transitions. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except certain special commands are interpreted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.3.1.6" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK" >No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to ERTMS/ETCS equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="2.6.4.1.7" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Level STM uses no ERTMS/ETCS track-train transmission except to announce/command level transitions and specific commands related to balise transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No data except level transition commands and certain special commands are interpreted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="2.6.4.1.8" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">The information displayed to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying national system. The active STM is indicated to the driver as part of that information.

    <paragraph id="2.6.5.1.7" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has to observe the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release
speed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="3.8.1.1" type="REQUIREMENT" optional="TRUE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: Structure of an MA):
a) The End Of Authority (EOA) is the location to which the train is authorised to move.
b) The Target Speed at the EOA is the permitted speed at the EOA; when the target speed is not zero, the EOA is called the Limit of Authority (LOA). This target speed
can be time limited.
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the EOA that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation.
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined
time.
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity of the EOA, when the target speed is zero. One release speed can be associated
with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section Error! Reference source not found.).
f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.
- A first time out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is called the Section time-out.
- In addition, a second time out value can be attached to the End Section of the MA. This second time out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="3.8.1.2" type="REQUIREMENT" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">The values of the time-outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="3.8.1.3" type="NOTE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):
- the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to fixed block principles)
- the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to moving block principles)
- the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of
operation)</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="3.8.1.4" type="NOTE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="3.8.1.5" type="NOTE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Note: Time-out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:
a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the EOA/LOA: When a signalman requests a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.
b) End Section time-out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.
c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that the train has successfully stopped before its end of authority. If the overlap is still unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="3.8.1.6" type="NOTE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance to End Of Authority (with target speed equal to zero) a target speed higher than zero can be given (speed at LOA, Limit Of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside to ensure that the safe distance beyond the EOA/LOA is long enough to brake the train from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the responsibility of the on-board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is received when the Limit of Authority is passed.</paragraph>

In this case, it is not convenient to preprogram the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.</paragraph>

Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear forward motion.

    <paragraph id="3.13.9.4.2" type="NOTE" scope="OBU">Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance. The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the EoA to the Supervised Location.</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="3.A3.4.1.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">The situations acting on the "status" of stored information are:
a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.7.3.3, 3.10.2.1.2);
b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.7.3.3);
c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.7.3.3, 3.8.4.2.2);
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time-out (3.8.4.4.2) ;
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.7.3.3, 3.8.4.1.2);
f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked (3.16.2.5.2);
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ;
i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ;
j) the train category, axle load, loading gauge or power supply is changed (3.18.3.7) ;
k) driver closes the desk during SoM ;
l) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and train is at standstill (3.16.2.7)
m) inconsistency in a balise group marked as linked and no linking is used onboard (3.16.2.4.4.2)</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="3.A3.4.1.3" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">Depending on the situation, the action can be:

    <paragraph id="3.A3.10.5" type="NOTE" scope="TRACK">Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to 0s and 2 s, the locking will remain until the target speed monitoring is left, even if the train speed comes below the target speed. This avoids "jumping" indications. It also makes it possible to release the brakes before a speed reduction, without having the curves moving back again. It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the driver releases the brakes too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue. To keep 2 s between the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated first and thus may avoid emergency brake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="3.A3.10.6" type="NOTE" scope="TRACK">Note: If feedback has started but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback function will remain active until the target point is reached. This avoids "jumping" indications in some rare situations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="4.8.1" type="TITLE" scope="OBU">Introduction</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.1.1" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">The aim of this chapter is to give an overview on which information is accepted/rejected depending on the state of the on-board (level, mode) and on the nature of the received information ( transmission medium, type of information: normal or infill).</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.1.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 "Accepted information depending on the level and transmission media", the third filter in section 4.8.4 "Accepted information depending on the modes".</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.1.3" type="REQUIREMENT" scope="OBU">If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.1.3.1" type="REQUIREMENT" scope="OBU" >Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first considering the on-board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1], [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied, shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.1.4" type="NOTE" scope="OBU">Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a change of level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment - still unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes in which this information is otherwise useless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.1.5" type="REQUIREMENT" scope="OBU">If a message contains in-fill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all other non-infill information in that message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.1.6" type="REQUIREMENT" scope="OBU">When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be evaluated prior to any other location related information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.2" type="TITLE" scope="OBU">Assumptions</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.2.1" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">The following tables shall be applied assuming that:
a) the information complies with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16)
b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation, or the balise group crossing direction (for SL, PS and SH engines).(see section 3.6.3)
c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the "RBC" information which is marked "A" (Accepted) comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this information is received from the "Accepting" RBC while the "Handing Over" RBC is still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed exception1: the information "Acknowledgement of Train Data", "Trackside constituent system version", "Initiation of Communication Session", "Session
Management" and "Acknowledgement of Session Termination" shall be immediately accepted.
exception2: the information "Co-operative shortening of MA" and "Revocation of Emergency Stop" shall be rejected."
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG.</paragraph>

a) Starting from the information currently used by on-board at the moment the level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted.
b) For each information update related to a re-evaluated set of information, the same rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted outside a level/RBC transition context.
c) The information resulting from this sequential update shall then be used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="4.8.5.7" type="NOTE" scope="OBU">Note: Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be accepted or rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.1.2) depending on the given stop location. This decision is considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause
3.10.2.1.4).
For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see clause 3.10.2.1.3) when re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.</paragraph>

Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="5.3.1.1" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the scope of UNISIG Class 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.1.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and/or by a state
transition chart (where convenient). All elements (States, events, transitions) of the state transition charts are explained within explanatory tables. The contents of these explanatory tables must be considered as mandatory requirements whenever expressed in such a way (e. g. "shall", "must never").</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.1.3" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.1.3.1" type="NOTE" scope="OBU">Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e.g.  cut off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment).</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.1.4" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is retained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.2" type="TITLE" scope="OBU">Definitions</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.2.1" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">Procedures
A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.2.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Entities
The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i.e. the entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.2.3" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">States
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not completely satisfied.
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.
Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another one. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force branching in states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.3.2.4" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK" >Transitions
Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the same time. When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditions to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.</paragraph>

b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR
c) Once a mission is ended, OR
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.4.1.2" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU">The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in Stand-By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.4.1.3" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU" >Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission is not the only possibility, the engine may become remote controlled (i.e. the on-board switches to Sleeping mode).</paragraph>

- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable (e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).
- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the interface between RBCs is unavailable).
- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).
- In level 2/3, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection with the interlocking)
- In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route cannot be set)
- In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened due to a time out).</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.8.1.3" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">In level 0 areas, overriding the EOA (passing a signal at danger) is only a national procedure. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not supervise the train movements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.8.1.4" type="REQUIREMENT" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Receiving an order from the signalman to pass the EoA, the driver must then be able to inhibit this supervision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.8.1.4.1" type="NOTE" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Note: The driver must not use the "Override" procedure unless authorised by trackside personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures.</paragraph>

    <paragraph id="5.8.1.6" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">Note: Passing the EoA by using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the train driving. Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects "override".</paragraph>
    <paragraph id="5.8.1.7" type="DEFINITION" scope="OBU_AND_TRACK">In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:
a) transmitting "stop in SR mode"
b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode
c) transmitting "stop in SH mode"
d) not contained in the list of expected balises in SH mode"
e) Intentionally deleted</paragraph>
